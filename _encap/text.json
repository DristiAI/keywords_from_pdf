structure of java applets and applications  how java applications are executed  how applets are invoked and executed  the java language  part i  comments  declarations  expressions  statements  garbage collection  java semanticsportabilityjava programs are portable across operating systems and hardware environments portability is to your advantage because   you need only one version of your software to serve a broad market   the internet  in effect  becomes one giant  dynamic library   you are no longer limited by your particular computer platform three features make java string programs portable 1  the language  the java language is completely specified  all data type sizes andformats are defined as part of the language  by contrast  c c   leaves these details  up to the compiler implementor  and many c c   programs thereforejava basicsjava basics  2  1996 2003 jguru com  all rights reserved are not portable 2  the library  the java class library is available on any machine with a javaruntime system  because a portable program is of no use if you cannot use thesame class library on every platform  window manager function calls in a macapplication written in c c    for example  do not port well to a pc 3  the byte code  the java runtime system does not compile your source codedirectly into machine language  an inflexible and nonportable representation ofyour program  instead  java programs are translated into machine independentbyte code  the byte code is easily interpreted and therefore can be executed onany platform having a java runtime system   the latest versions of the netscapenavigator browser  for example  can run applets on virtually any platform  securitythe java language is secure in that it is very difficult to write incorrect code orviruses that can corrupt steal your data  or harm hardware such as hard disks there are two main lines of defense   interpreter level   no pointer arithmetic  garbage collection  array bounds checking  no illegal data conversions  browser level  applies to applets only    no local file i o  sockets back to host only  no calls to native methodsrobustnessthe java language is robust  it has several features designed to avoid crashesduring program execution  including   no pointer arithmeticjava basics  1996 2003 jguru com  all rights reserved java basics  3  garbage collection  no bad addresses  array and string bounds checking  no jumping to bad method addresses  interfaces and exceptionsjava program structurea file containing java source code is considered a compilation unit  such acompilation unit contains a set of classes and  optionally  a package definition togroup related classes together  classes contain data and method members thatspecify the state and behavior of the objects in your program java programs come in two flavors   standalone applications that have no initial context such as a pre existing mainwindow  applets for www programmingthe major differences between applications and applets are   applets are not allowed to use file i o and sockets  other than to the hostplatform   applications do not have these restrictions   an applet must be a subclass of the java applet class  aplications do not need tosubclass any particular class   unlike applets  applications can have menus   unlike applications  applets need to respond to predefined lifecycle messagesfrom the www browser in which they re running java program executionthe java byte code compiler translates a java source file into machine independent byte code  the byte code for each publicly visible class is placed in aseparate file  so that the java runtime system can easily find it  if your programinstantiates an object of class a  for example  the class loader searches thedirectories listed in your classpath environment variable for a file called a classthat contains the class definition and byte code for class a there is no link phase for java programs  all linking is done dynamically atjava basicsjava basics  4  1996 2003 jguru com  all rights reserved runtime the following diagram shows an example of the java compilation and executionsequence for a source file named a java containing public class a and non publicclass b java programs are  in effect  distributed applications  you may think of them as acollection of dlls  dynamically loadable libraries  that are linked on demand atruntime  when you write your own java applications  you will often integrateyour program with already existing portions of code that reside on othermachines a simple applicationconsider the following trivial application that prints  hi there  to standardoutput java basics  1996 2003 jguru com  all rights reserved java basics  5public class trivialapplication       args 0  is first argument     args 1  the second  public static void main string args         system out println  hi there       the command java trivialapplication tells the java runtime system to beginwith the class file trivialapplication class and to look in that file for amethod with the signature public static void main string args    the main   method will always reside in one of your class files  the javalanguage does not allow methods outside of class definitions  the class  in effect creates scoped symbol startingclassname main for your main   method applet executionan applet is a java program that runs within a java compatible www browser orin an appletviewer  to execute your applet  the browser   creates an instance of your applet  sends messages to your applet to automatically invoke predefined lifecyclemethodsthe predefined methods automatically invoked by the runtime system are   init    this method takes the place of the applet constructor and is only calledonce during applet creation  instance variables should be initialized in this method gui components such as buttons and scrollbars should be added to the gui inthis method   start    this method is called once after init   and whenever your applet isrevisited by your browser  or when you deiconify your browser  this methodshould be used to start animations and other threads   paint graphics g   this method is called when the applet drawing area needsto be redrawn  anything not drawn by contained components must be drawn inthis method  bitmaps  for example  are drawn here  but buttons are not becausethey handle their own painting   stop    this method is called when you leave an applet or when you iconifyyour browser  the method should be used to suspend animations and otherjava basicsjava basics  6  1996 2003 jguru com  all rights reserved threads so they do not burden system resources unnecessarily  it is guaranteed tobe called before destroy     destroy    this method is called when an applet terminates  for example  whenquitting the browser  final clean up operations such as freeing up systemresources with dispose   should be done here  the dispose   method of frameremoves the menu bar  therefore  do not forget to call super dispose   if youoverride the default behavior the basic structure of an applet that uses each of these predefined methods is import java applet applet    include all awt class definitionsimport java awt   public class applettemplate extends applet    public void init           create gui  initialize applet     public void start

   free up system resources  stop threads    all you have to do is fill in the appropriate methods to bring your applet to life  ifyou don t need to use one or more of these predefined methods  simply leave themout of your applet  the applet will ignore messages from the browser attemptingto invoke any of these methods that you don t use a simple appletthe following complete applet displays  hello

instead of a www browser to test applets  forexample  the output of trivialapplet on an appletviewer looks like html applet interfacethe html applet tag is similar to the html img tag  and has the form  applet code appletname class width w height h  parameters   applet where the optional parameters are a list of parameter definitions of the form  param name n value v an example tag with parameter definitions is  applet code appletname class width 300 height 200  param name p1 value 34  param name p2 value  test    applet where p1 and p2 are user defined parameters the code  width  and height parameters are mandatory  the parameterscodebase  alt  archives  align  vspace  and hspace are optional within the applet  tag itself  your applet can access any of these parameters by calling applet getparameter  p  which returns the string value of the parameter  for example  the applet import java applet applet public class paramtest extends applet    public void init        system out println  width is     getparameter  width        system out println  p1 is        getparameter  p1    java basicsjava basics  8  1996 2003 jguru com  all rights reserved     system out

where all text between the opening    and closing    is ignored  and   c   style single line commentswhere all text from the opening    to the end of the line is ignored note that these two comments can make a very useful combination  c stylecomments             cannot be nested  but can contain c   style comments this leads to the interesting observation that if you always use c   stylecomments           you can easily comment out a section of code by surroundingit with c style comments  so try to use c   style comments for your  normal code commentary  and reserve c style comments for commenting out sections ofcode the java language also has a document comment     document comment   these comments are processed by the javadoc program to generatedocumentation from your source code  for example     this class does blah blah blah   class blah        this method does nothing          this is a multiple line comment      the leading   is not placed in documentation        public

allocatesmemory on the stack for a button object and makes b refer to it  by contrast  youmust specifically instantiate java objects with the new operator  for example java basicsjava basics  10  1996 2003 jguru com  all rights reserved    java codevoid foo         define a reference to a button  init to null  button b      allocate space for a button  b points to it  b   new button  ok     int i   2  as the accompanying figure shows  this code places a reference b to the buttonobject on the stack and allocates memory for the new object on the heap the equivalent c   and c statements that would allocate memory on the heapwould be    c   codebutton  b   null          declare a new button pointerb   new button  ok        point it to a new button   c code   button  b   null                  declare a new button pointer   b   calloc 1  sizeof button       allocate space for a button   init b   ok                       something like this to init b   all java objects reside on the heap  there are no objects stored on the stack storing objects on the heap does not cause potential memory leakage problemsbecause of garbage collection each java primitive type has an equivalent object type  e g   integer  byte float  double  these primitive types are provided in addition to object typespurely for efficiency  an int is much more efficient than an integer java basics  1996 2003 jguru

terminated every string literal such as a string literal is interpreted by the java compiler asnew string  a string literal  java strings are constant in length and content  for variable length strings  usestringbuffer objects strings may be concatenated by using the plus operator string s    one     two      s     onetwo you may concatenate any object to a string  you use the tostring   method toconvert objects to a string  and primitive types are converted by the compiler for example string s    1 1     2     s     1 1 2 the length of a string may be obtained with string method length    e g   abc  length   has the value 3 to convert an int to a string  use string s   string valueof 4  to convert a string to an int  use int a   integer parseint  4   array objectsin c and c    arrays are pointers to data in memory  java arrays are objects thatknow the number and type of their elements  the first element is index 0  as inc c   generic array object  elementsjava basicsjava

object  it does not allocate memory for the arrayobject nor does it allocate the elements of the array in addition  you may notspecify a size within the square brackets to allocate an array  use the new operator int   a   new int 5       java code  make array of 5 intsnew int 5 5int00000in c or c    by contrast  you would write either   c c   code  make array of 5 ints on the stack   int a 5  or   c c   code  make array of 5 ints on the heap   java basics  1996 2003 jguru com  all rights reserved java basics  13int  a   new int 5  an array of java objects such as   java code  make array of 5

loop that the break or continue apply to   each loop can bepreceded by a label  java semanticswe say that the java language has  reference semantics  and c c   have  copysemantics   this means that java objects are passed to methods by reference injava  while objects are passed by value in c c   java primitive types  however  are not treated in the same way as java objects primitive types are assigned  compared  and passed as arguments using copyjava basicsjava basics  18  1996 2003 jguru com  all rights reserved semantics  just as in c c    for example  i   j for two int variables i and jperforms a 32 bit integer copy assignment of objectsassignment makes two variables refer to the same object  for example class data    public int data   0   public data int d    data   d    i       data a   new data 1      a data is 1i       data b   new data 2      b data is 2ii      b   a                    b data and a data are 1iii     a data   3               b data and a data are 3iv      a   new data 4           b data is 3  a data is 4to copy objects  define and use clone   class data implements cloneable    public int data   0   public data int d    data   d     public object clone

  3               b data is 1  a data is 3java basics  1996 2003 jguru com  all rights reserved java basics  19note  the above class definition requires exception handling code  we  however have not yet discussed exception handling  for now  pretend that it is notnecessary method parameters and return valuesarguments and return values for primitive types are passed by value to and fromall java methods because they are implied assignments  as in c c    however  alljava objects are passed by reference  for example  the c c   code    c   codeint foo int j    return j   34  button  bfoo button  b     if   b    null   return b   else return new button    or  in c   c code   int foo int j    return j   34  button  bfoo button  b     if   b    null   return b   else return calloc sizeof button    would be written in the java language    java codeint foo int j    return j   34  button bfoo button b     if   b    null   return b   else return new button  ok    equalitytwo java primitive types are equal  using the    operator  when they have thesame value  e g    3    3    however  two object variables are equal if and only ifthey refer to the same instantiated object  a  shallow  comparison  for example void test      data a   new data 1    data b   new data 2    data c   new data 1       a    b is false     a    c is false  in c    this d be true java basicsjava basics  20  1996 2003 jguru com  all rights reserved   data d   a   data e   a      d    e is true      d e are referring to same object to perform a  deep  comparison  the convention is to define a method calledequals    you would rewrite data as class data    public int data   0   public data int d    data   d     boolean equals data d       return data    d data        data a   new data 1  data b   new data 1     a equals b  is true    no pointers the java language does not have pointer types nor address arithmetic  javavariables are either primitive types or references to objects  to illustrate thedifference between c c   and java semantics  consider the following equivalentcode fragments    c   code  c code would be similar stack  s   new stack     point to a new stacks  push         dereference and access method push  the equivalent java code is    java code   internally  consider s to be a  stack   stack s   new stack      dereference s automaticallys push      garbage collectionan automatic garbage collector deallocates memory for objects that are no longerneeded by your program  thereby relieving you from the tedious and error pronejava basics  1996 2003 jguru com  all rights reserved java basics  21task of deallocating your own memory as a consequence of automatic garbage collection and lack of pointers  a javaobject is either null or valid  there is no way to refer to an invalid or stale object one that has been deallocated  to illustrate the effect of a garbage collector  consider the following c   functionthat allocates 1000 objects on the heap via the new operator  a similar c functionwould allocate memory using calloc malloc     c   codevoid f      t  t   for  int i   1  i    1000  i         t   new t     ack         every time the loop body is executed  a new instance of class t is instantiated  andt is pointed to it  but what happens to the instance that t used to point to  it sstill allocated  but nothing points to it and therefore it s inaccessible  memory inthis state is referred to as  leaked  memory in the java language  memory leaks are not an issue  the following java methodcauses no ill effects    java codevoid f      t t   for  int i   1  i    1000  i         t   new t       in java  each time t is assigned a new reference  the old reference is now availablefor garbage collection  note that it isn t immediately freed  it remains allocateduntil the garbage collector thread is next executed and notices that it can be freed put simply  automatic garbage collection reduces programming effort programming errors  and
